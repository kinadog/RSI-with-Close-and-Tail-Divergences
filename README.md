# RSI with Close and Tail Devergences

## RSI divergence is a cornerstone signal for both stock and cryptocurrency traders, renowned for its reliability.

### The basis for measuring divergence can vary:

- Historically, it's been determined by the candlestick's closing price.
- However, a contemporary approach uses the tail values, specifically the high and low prices, of the candlestick.
Depending on the criteria selected, the resultant signals can be markedly different.

### Our innovative indicator offers:

1. Divergence tracking based on the closing price of the candlestick.
2. Divergence tracking considering the candlestick's peak and trough values.
3. A unique convergence of both types of divergence signals.

With this tool, traders are empowered to make informed decisions, anchored in precise divergence cues.


### This indicator boasts the following capabilities:

- Displays divergence based on closing price, highs/lows, as well as a unique combined criterion.
- Highlights pivot points.
- Denotes divergence spots on the RSI chart with lines.
- Offers a background color representation instead of labels.
